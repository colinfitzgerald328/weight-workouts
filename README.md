This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


I'm currently building an app to log workouts. Stack is next.js and react. 

The build is currently optimized for mobile, but I plan to build a more desktop friendly version once I have plugged in all of the APIs. 

The backend is a Flask App that serves MySQL via Google Cloud. 

If you would like to collaborate, shoot me an email: colinfitzgerald@berkeley.edu. 

Here are some screenshots:

Fair warning, I accidentally nuked the backend so you cannot currently use this app. I'll reconfigure the backend database soon, but for the time being feel free to browse the code. 

Thanks for your patience!
